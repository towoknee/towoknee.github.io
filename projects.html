			RIP, or Rage-Inducing Platformer, is a 2D platformer game created in Unity. 
			The main objective of this game is to get from start to finish, under a time limit, with multiple obstacles standing in the way.
			I worked on this project with 4 others, with each of us taking on certain roles such as UI, physics, animation, and input. 
			I took on the UI position, fleshing out various visual components allowing players to have a better experience with the game.
			The scripts I wrote were written in C#, and I was responsible for features such as the timer, score, scene transitions, objects, and setting.
			We all dabbled in each others' roles as well, and I did a bit of animation as well as game input for our project. 
			Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx1-ISlhUis" target="_blank">link</a> to the trailer I produced and the 
			github <a href="https://github.com/towoknee/RIP-1" target="_blank">repository</a> for this game.
