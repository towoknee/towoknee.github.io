			<h2>RIP</h2>
			<p><img src="/images/ripSS.png" width="85%" alt="game"></p>
			<p>
			RIP, or Rage-Inducing Platformer, is a 2D platformer game created in Unity. 
			The main objective of this game is to get from start to finish, under a time limit, with multiple obstacles standing in the way.
			I worked on this project with 4 others, with each of us taking on certain roles such as UI, physics, animation, and input. 
			I took on the UI position, fleshing out various visual components allowing players to have a better experience with the game.
			The scripts I wrote were written in C#, and I was responsible for features such as the timer, score, scene transitions, objects, and setting.
			We all dabbled in each others' roles as well, and I did a bit of animation as well as game input for our project. 
			Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx1-ISlhUis" target="_blank">link</a> to the trailer I produced and the 
			github <a href="https://github.com/towoknee/RIP-1" target="_blank">repository</a> for this game.

			<h2>KnoDaWae</h2>
			<p><img src="/images/kno.png" width="85%" alt="game2"></p>
			<p>
			KnoDaWae is an educational website that teaches novice programmers how to code in Python. 
			This project was created at HackDavis, a hackathon held at my university, along with 3 others. 
			Our goal was to explain a topic that is usually seen as dull and boring in a fun and entertaining way. 
			From this, we ended up making use of a popular meme during that time and made the learning process into an interactive story.
			We made use of HTML, CSS, and Javascript to build the site. By the end of the hackathon, we demoed our project and even ended
			up winning a prize... for best domain name. 
			Here's a  <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/towoknee/knodawae/blob/master/pages/index.html" target="_blank">demo</a>
			of the website, along with the <a href="https://github.com/towoknee/knodawae" target="_blank">repository</a>.
